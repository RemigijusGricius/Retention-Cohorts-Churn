# Retention, Cohorts & Churn

Welcome to my project for Retention, Cohorts & Churn sprint. Where I analyzed retention rate for company for six week to see how customer retention changed weekly

## Repository Contents:
1. `Cohortproject.sql` â€“ SQL query to calculate retention rate in our data.
2. Link to [Google spreadsheet with SQL query](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JDskbDGFYeymJ_cEmW59Fpk6oLQCL2LInqiREFWCQeA/edit?usp=sharing) in case if .sql file is not able to open.
3. Link to [retention rate results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rWChHRHqWxj2HcnMHw78XRyHM2PyAXxK5531H9XPG78/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Additional [Google spreadsheet for data validation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YpMPXINNsROnVvyhLCa8Sfkt-8QV7SgiJ-SJ5qH1Ls4/edit?usp=sharing) done in excel.

## Purpose:
To find out pattern of retention and to identify week where retention rate was the highest and lowest that company would have guidelines in which week to concentrate.

## Research Findings:
1. Customers that started their subscriptions on 11.01 and 11.08 had the lowest retention rate after all weeks. We should compare this week with the following weeks because the retention rate in the following weeks shows that it is rising, and we keep customers with the company. We need to find out what has changed in the following weeks compared to the first two weeks.
2. We need extra attention to our first week when customers starts their subscription because in this week the biggest part of customers cancel their subscriptions. Additional attention to the onboarding period is crucial.
